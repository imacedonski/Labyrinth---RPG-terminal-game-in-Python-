# Labyrinth---RPG-terminal-game-in-Python-
This is a RPG terminal game which I created during my studies in Python. Check README.txt file or projekt.pdf [in Polish] for more detailed description.

EDIT: This was the first bigger project that I've written (without any commercial experience), so code looks pretty rubbish.
