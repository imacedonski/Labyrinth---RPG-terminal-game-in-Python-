This is a project which I created during my studdies for lecture called Python 2.
It's the RPG game in which you expand labyrinth, do questions and fight with monsters. 
You have some additional options during the game like viewing map, making saves etc.
The main purpose of this game is to defeat final boss on location 13.
The main file is called 'game.py'. Every python file should be in the same direction to work properly.


You can check detailed documentation in PDF file (in Polish) and UML Diagram (both files are in folder Documentation).
