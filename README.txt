This is a project which I created during my studdies for lecture called Python 2.
It's the RPG game in which you expand labyrinth, do questions and fight with monsters. 
You have some additional options during the game like viewing map, make saves etc.
The main purpose of this game is to defeat final boss on location 13. 
The game is rather very simple, to check every command available in game type 'help' in console. 

You can check detailed documentation in PDF file (in Polish) and UML Diagram.
